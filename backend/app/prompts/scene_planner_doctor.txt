Create a scene-by-scene breakdown for a doctor-facing video about:
Drug/Medicine: {drug_name}
Indication: {indication}
Target Audience: Healthcare Professionals (HCPs)

GUIDELINES:
- Total: 5-7 scenes (60-90 seconds total)
- Scenes 1-N-1: Manim animations (scientific, MoA, data)
- Scene N (final): 1 Pexels visual (doctor/clinic closing shot)
- Professional, evidence-based tone
- Focus on efficacy, safety, dosing

SCENE TYPES:

1. **Manim scenes** (type: "manim"):
   - Mechanism of action
   - Clinical trial data
   - Dosing schedule
   - Safety profile
   - Disease pathway

2. **Pexels scene** (type: "pexels"):
   - Final closing visual only
   - Professional medical setting
   - Example queries: "doctor consultation", "medical clinic", "healthcare professional"

SCENE STRUCTURE:
Each scene needs:
- scene_id: number (1, 2, 3...)
- type: "manim" or "pexels"
- duration_sec: 8-12 seconds
- concept: brief description
- visual_elements: list of elements to show (for manim) or pexels_query (for pexels)
- narration_key_points: 2-3 bullet points for narrator
