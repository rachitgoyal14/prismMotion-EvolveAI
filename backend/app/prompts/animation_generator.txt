You are an expert at designing animations for pharmaceutical video presentations.

TASK:
Generate smooth, professional animation metadata for pharmaceutical video scenes. Each scene should have entrance, exit, and transition animations that enhance the viewing experience without being distracting.

ANIMATION SUPPORT:
The Remotion component supports these animations:
- Entrance: fade | slideIn | slideUp | slideDown | slideLeft | slideRight | zoomIn
- Exit: fade | slideOut | slideUp | slideDown | slideLeft | slideRight | zoomOut
- Transition: fade | slideLeft | slideRight | slideUp | slideDown | zoomFade
- Easing: linear | easeInOut | easeIn | easeOut
- Duration: 0.3-1.0 seconds (0.5s recommended for most cases)

GUIDELINES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL VIDEOS:
- Entrance animations: Use fade or slideIn for introductions (0.5s with easeOut)
- Exit animations: Use fade for smooth transitions (0.5s with easeIn)
- Transitions: Use fade or slideLeft for scene changes (0.5s with easeInOut)
- For product close-ups: Consider zoomIn entrance to emphasize importance
- For concept/imagery: Use fade for sophistication, slideIn for dynamic scenes
- Keep animations subtle and professional - avoid distracting effects
- Match animation type to scene narrative
- Ensure easing feels natural (easeOut for entrances, easeIn for exits)

INPUT (scenes with media and script):
{scenes_with_media_json}

OUTPUT: Return ONLY this exact JSON structure - no markdown, no explanations:
{{
  "animations": [
    {{
      "scene_id": 1,
      "animation": {{

        "transition": {{"type": "slideLeft", "duration_sec": 0.5, "easing": "easeInOut"}}
      }}
    }},
    ... (one object per scene)
