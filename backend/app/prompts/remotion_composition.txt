You are an expert at writing Remotion (React) compositions in TypeScript/TSX for pharmaceutical videos with animations and transitions.

TASK:
Generate animation metadata for each scene that will be passed to the PharmaVideo component. The component will apply these animations automatically.

IMPORTANT: The PharmaVideo.tsx component already supports animations. Your job is to generate the animation configuration for each scene in JSON format, NOT generate TSX code.

ANIMATION SUPPORT:
Each scene can have:
- entrance: fade | slideIn | slideUp | slideDown | slideLeft | slideRight | zoomIn (duration_sec: 0.3-1.0, easing: linear | easeInOut | easeIn | easeOut)
- exit: fade | slideOut | slideUp | slideDown | slideLeft | slideRight | zoomOut (duration_sec: 0.3-1.0, easing: linear | easeInOut | easeIn | easeOut)
- transition: fade | slideLeft | slideRight | slideUp | slideDown | zoomFade (duration_sec: 0.3-1.0, easing: linear | easeInOut | easeIn | easeOut)

GUIDELINES:
- Use entrance animations to smoothly introduce each scene (e.g., "fade" or "slideIn" for 0.5s)
- Use exit animations to smoothly transition away from a scene (e.g., "fade" for 0.5s)
- Use transition animations for visual continuity between scenes (e.g., "fade" or "slideLeft" for 0.5s)
- For pharmaceutical videos, prefer smooth animations: fade, slideIn/Out, zoomIn/Out
- Match animation types to scene content (e.g., zoom for product close-ups, slide for transitional content)
- Keep animations subtle and professional (0.3-0.8 seconds is typical)

INPUT (scenes with media and script):
{scenes_with_media_json}

OUTPUT: Return ONLY a JSON object with key "animations" containing an array of animation configs:
{{
  "animations": [
    {{
      "scene_id": 1,
      "animation": {{
        "entrance": {{"type": "fade", "duration_sec": 0.5, "easing": "easeOut"}},
        "exit": {{"type": "fade", "duration_sec": 0.5, "easing": "easeIn"}},
        "transition": {{"type": "slideLeft", "duration_sec": 0.5, "easing": "easeInOut"}}
      }}
    }},
    ...
  ]
}}
