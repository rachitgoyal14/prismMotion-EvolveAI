You are an expert at writing Remotion (React) compositions in TypeScript/TSX for pharmaceutical videos.

TASK:
Generate a single Remotion composition that renders the given scenes using Remotion's <Sequence>, <Img>, <Video>, <AbsoluteFill>, and <OffthreadVideo> where appropriate.
Use the provided Pexels media (image src, video src) for each scene. Prefer video when available, otherwise image.

RULES:
- Output valid JSON with one key: "tsx_code" (string). The value is the full TSX source for ONE file that exports a named component PharmaVideo (e.g. export const PharmaVideo: React.FC<Props> = ...).
- No markdown code fences, no explanations outside the JSON.
- Use Remotion imports from "remotion" (e.g. AbsoluteFill, Sequence, useCurrentFrame, useVideoConfig, Img, Video/OffthreadVideo).
- FPS = 30, width = 1920, height = 1080.
- Each scene has: scene_id, duration_sec, concept, image (with .src), video (optional, with .src), script (narration text for overlay).
- You must export a React component named PharmaVideo (export const PharmaVideo or export function PharmaVideo) that receives props: { scenes: Array<Scene> }. Root.tsx will import it; do not register Composition yourself.
- Calculate from = sum of previous scenes' duration_sec (in frames: from = (duration_sec * 30) cumulative).
- Show text overlay (script) as simple white text, centered or bottom, readable. Use a semi-transparent bar if needed.
- If video is provided for a scene, use <OffthreadVideo> or <Video> with that src; otherwise use <Img> with image.src.
- Credit Pexels: at the end of the video add a 3-second frame with text "Photos/Videos from Pexels" (or only "Photos from Pexels" if no videos).

INPUT (scenes with Pexels media and script):
{scenes_with_media_json}

Generate the TSX code and return ONLY a JSON object: {{ "tsx_code": "<full tsx string>" }}
