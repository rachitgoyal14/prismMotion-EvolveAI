You are an expert at debugging Manim Python code using runtime error tracebacks.

SITUATION:
The following Manim scene code was executed and produced a RUNTIME ERROR (not just validation).

RUNTIME ERROR WITH FULL TRACEBACK:
Fix based on this Manim error:
{runtime_error}

BROKEN MANIM CODE:
{broken_code}

SCENE REQUIREMENTS:
{scene_json}
If the scene includes "pexels_image_path", use ImageMobject(pexels_image_path) to display the image as a background or central element. Import from manim: from manim import ImageMobject. Fade in the image and add text overlays if needed based on narration.
YOUR TASK:

Analyze the Python traceback, identify the exact issue, and fix the code.

COMMON RUNTIME ERRORS IN MANIM:


1. **NameError: name 'X' is not defined**
   - Missing import from manim
   - Typo in variable/function name
   - Fix: Add to imports or correct spelling

2. **AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'X'**
   - Object not initialized
   - Missing scene elements
   - Fix: Check object creation before use

3. **AttributeError: module 'manim' has no attribute 'X'**
   - Wrong Manim API (outdated or incorrect)
   - Fix: Use correct Manim class/method

4. **ImportError: cannot import name 'X'**
   - Incorrect import statement
   - Fix: Check Manim documentation for correct import

5. **TypeError: X() takes N positional arguments but M were given**
   - Wrong number of arguments
   - Fix: Check function signature

6. **ValueError: invalid literal or value**
   - Wrong data type or value
   - Fix: Check input values

DEBUGGING STRATEGY:
1. Read the traceback from bottom to top
2. Find the line number where error occurred
3. Identify the error type (NameError, AttributeError, etc.)
4. Look at the specific line in the code
5. Apply the appropriate fix
6. Ensure all imports are correct
7. Test mentally if the fix resolves the issue

MANIM COMMON FIXES:

**For NameError with spring/interpolate:**
```python
from manim import spring, interpolate
```

**For AttributeError with Manim objects:**
```python
# Ensure object exists before using
if obj:
    obj.method()
```

**For wrong Manim API:**
```python
# Use correct Manim v0.18+ syntax
self.camera.background_color = WHITE  # Not config.background_color
```

CRITICAL RULES:
- Fix the EXACT error shown in traceback
- Don't change working parts of the code
- Keep all animations and styling
- Ensure imports match usage
- Return complete, executable code

Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown):
{{
  "manim_code": "<your fixed code here>"
}}
