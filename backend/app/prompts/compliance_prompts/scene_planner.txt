- product_ad: Product benefits, mechanism, indication, safety (no claims beyond documents)

RULES:
- Output ONLY valid JSON
- Do NOT include markdown, explanations, or extra text
- Each scene = one clear idea
- Scene duration must be an INTEGER between 5 and 12
- Provide EXACTLY 2 or 3 Pexels search terms per scene
- Pexels terms must be short, generic, and visual
- If reference documents are provided, base claims strictly on them
- Do NOT invent medical, clinical, or regulatory claims
- If unsure, keep the scene high-level and non-claiming

ASSET USAGE (optional):
- Uploaded assets may include a brand logo and/or images
- Available assets, if any, will be listed below
- If a scene should use an uploaded asset, include:
  - "asset_hint": one of ["logo", "uploaded_image"]
  - "preferred_asset": filename (optional)
- If no uploaded asset is suitable, omit asset_hint and use stock visuals
